				<header><h2>Getting Started</h2></header>
			
					<p>Contra is an arcade game developed by Konami in 1987. Konami produced their own home version of Contra for the NES, which was released in February 1988 in Japan and North America. The PAL version, titled Probotector, was released in December 28, 1990.</p>

					<p>The NES version of Contra differs from the arcade game in a few ways. All ten stages from the arcade version are present, although the "core" segments are no longer individual stages but boss battles that occur at the end of each base stage, reducing the total number of stages to eight. The base stages themselves were also made into linear levels instead of their original maze-like structure (resulting in the removal of the map display) and the time limit was removed as well. The rest of the game's stages were also modified with the addition of more traps (such as surfacing spiked walls, mortar launchers, and bottomless pits). The design of the Area 3 boss (originally Area 4 in the arcade version) was changed as well.</p>

					<p>All six power-ups from the arcade version are present, with the Machine Gun and the Laser Rifle now represented by letter-based Falcon icons (an "M" and an "L" respectively) like the other four power-ups. A seventh power-up is also introduced called the "Special", which destroys all on-screen enemies once picked up. It is represented by an unmarked Falcon icon. Unlike the arcade version, the flying capsules appear regardless of which weapon the player is using.</p>

				<header><h2>Enemies</h2></header>
			
			
				<p>Infantry</p>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li><strong>Soldier</strong> - Soldiers run across the screen and jump when they reach a ledge. They may fire bullets at you occasionally. In bases, they run or jump across the background, stopping to shoot at you before they leave.</li>
					
				  <li><strong>Sniper</strong> - Snipers stand in place and fire at you with much better aim than the other enemies. They can fire in any direction.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Scuba Soldier</strong> - They attack by firing a shell into the air that splits into three pieces before it hits the ground. It is difficult if not impossible to kill these guys. However, they can only fire directly upwards, so their bombs are usually easy to avoid.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Gunner</strong> - Gunners attack from stationary cannons that fire large bullets at you. The bullets are fast, but the gunner pauses after firing three shots, giving you time to move into position. You can avoid getting shot by crouching.</li>
				
				</ul>
				
				<p>Artillery</p>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li><strong>Wall turret</strong> - Gray boxes with a rotating cannon are very common in the first half of the game. They're quite easy to destroy since they have a limited number of firing directions. They're initially inactive but when you get close to them, they'll activate and start firing at you.</li>
					
				  <li><strong>Cannons</strong> - Cannons pop out of the ground when you are within firing range. They can only fire ahead, and you are safe shooting at them when you crouch because their bullets fly over you.</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				
				<p>Aliens</p>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li><strong>Alien head</strong> - This head appears near the beginning of the alien base. It's only attack is to spit out Floaters. Push yourself against the wall to the right and fire diagonally upward to hit the mouth.</li>
					
				  <li><strong>Floaters</strong> - Floating aliens slowly move around and try to run into you; they have no other form of attack. They're easily destroyed, but be sure to take them out quickly, as larger numbers can overwhelm you.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Alien mouths</strong> - The alien version of a turret, it is attached to floors and ceilings and attack by creating spores that home in on you rather quickly if you don't destroy them. They are stationary, but take a few shots to destroy.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Spores</strong> - Spores are smaller than floaters, and they are much faster. They travel straight for you, and typically end up moving into your line of fire. Watch out for the few that slip by.</li>

					<li><strong>Egg hatch</strong> - Egg hatches release baby aliens in the form of Crawlers. They must be destroyed in order to prevent further Crawlers from appearing and interfering with you mission.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Crawlers</strong> - Crawlers hop out of the hatches and run along the floor to reach you, or run across the ceiling and dive down at you. They will defend the heart that feeds the alien base with their lives.</li>
					
				</ul>

				<header><h2>Stage 1</h2></header>
			
				<p>You start out on the ledge at the far left. You can either drop down into the water (it won't kill you) or stay on top. Head right and kill the Sniper on the bottom ledge near the water ahead. Hit the weapon sensor for a Machine gun. Shortly after an item capsule, will fly from left to right. Shoot it to get a Rapid fire upgrade which is useful when used in combination with the Machine gun. Another Sniper will be waiting ahead at the bottom, kill him the same way you did the last one. When you reach the bridge, you’ll have to carefully time your jumps across to ramain on the upper path; if you walk across instead, you will be caught by the explosion and fall through. Unlike the arcade version, the bridge explosions can not harm you.</p>

				<p>A second bridge follows the first bridge, and you must time your jumps in the same manner to cross it. A turret will be waiting for you on the opposite side of the bridge. If you're still on the top path, you can avoid it and move on, but you should stop and destroy it if you’re in the water. You will find two Snipers in a row hiding the underbrush up ahead. You should be able to spot their heads peeking out from the grass. Shoot them when they stand up to fire at you. An item capsule will fly which contains the Spread gun. You can only reach it if you’re on the top path. Otherwise, you can obtain another Spread gun later on. Fire the Spread gun rapidly to clear large numbers of enemies from your path.</p>

				<p>Shoot the Sniper on the ledge ahead of you, then drop to the lower ledge where the turret and weapon sensor are. Destroy the turret and collect the contents of the weapon sensor, a Fireball gun if you lost the Spread gun, or wish to switch weapons. Drop into the water and wade forward to the bottom ledge and destroy the turret to the right. Jump to the narrow ledge ahead then up to the high ledge on your left. Destroy the cannon that rises out of the ground. Then shoot the Sniper on the opposite side of screen. If you don’t yet have the Spread gun, destroy the weapon sensor under the ledge to obtain one. An item capsule will appear from the left that contains a Rapid fire upgrade.</p>
				
				<h3>Boss: Jungle fortress entrance</h3>
				
				<p>Before anything else, shoot the sniper perched on top the fortress. He is the biggest threat to your survival. Once he is eliminated, you should destroy the two turrets above the door. A safe way to the do this is to duck and fire on the top left or the middle ledge, which will be beyond the turrets' range of fire. You may also attack from the left edge of the small platform closest to the turrets, but you must be careful and ensure that the turret mortars can't touch you. Once the turrets have been removed, focus all of your firepower on the entrance to the fortress until it explodes. It is possible to rush your attack and destroy the door as quickly as you can, but you are likely to get hit by the turrets or the sniper if you are not patient and do not clear them out first.</p>

				<header><h2>Stage 2</h2></header>
			
				<p>The second stage employs a 3D perspective as the players move through the internal passages of an enemy base. To proceed through the base, you must destroy the power core seals placed at various points on the door, and then run forward to the next room. If you try to advance before the core is destroyed, you will hit the high-voltage current and become temporarily paralyzed by the shock, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Defending each room are turrets which are placed on the doors themselves, soldiers, and grenadiers. Two kinds of soldiers appear; standard soldiers and soldiers which provide weapons. Standard green soldiers compose much of the defense and provide only points when shot. Red soldiers provide a weapon or power-up when you shoot them. Only one such soldier will appear in each room.
				
				<p>Grenadiers are a big danger. Kill them as fast as you can or they’ll start tossing grenades at you. Rolling mines also pose a threat.The best way to deal with the rolling mines is to duck and shoot at one until it explodes, or move between two of them if there’s a space. The other way is to jump over them, but it’s dangerous to jump straight up above them. Instead, it's a better idea to jump to either side so that you don't come back down and land on them. Crouching on the ground will protect you from any gun fire. If there’s too much action on the screen, simply crouch and wait for the gun fire to die down. However, don't wait too long if grenadiers appear. Once it's safe, stand up and continue firing.
				
				<h4>Room 1</h4>
				
				<p>The seal is level with you’re gun so focus your shots at it until it explodes. You won't encounter much resistance here.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 2</h4>
				
				<p>The seal is on the left and a turret is on the right. Destroy the turret first, then go after the lock. Soldier appearance should remain light.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 3</h4>
				
				<p>The seal in this room is low to the ground. Crouch in the center of the room, and fire away until the seal is destroyed. Don't bother with the turrets.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 4</h4>
				
				<p>The seal is level with your gun, but there's a turret above it. Rolling mines will occasionally appear from the slots below the lock. Stand aligned with the lock and fire away. Once the rolling mines start appearing, crouch down and shoot the one that is threatening to hit you. Don't bother with the turret, but do crouch if it shoots at you.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 5</h4>
			
				<p>The final room shouldn't be too difficult, even though it's well defended. The best way to destroy the seal is to destroy the two turrets to the right and left of the lock, then concentrate on the lock itself until it blows up. The upper turret takes more effort to destroy, and is better left alone, but you must remember to crouch when it shoots at you.</p>
				
				<h3>Boss: Terminal 1</h3>
				
				<p>The boss at the core of the base is fought in a similar manner to your progress through the base itself. You can only move left or right and fire upwards. As soon as you’re able to move you should quickly head to either side of the room, in an effort to avoid turret bullets. Once the turrets start firing, stand below the closest turret, and stand as close as you can without getting hit by the bullets. You can only harm the turret when it is open. After you destroy the first turret, cross the room and attack the second one in the same manner.</p>

				<header><h2>Stage 3</h2></header>
			
				<p>The waterfall stage is the only stage which scrolls vertically. Your objective is to reach the top. In general, you will always jump up, but you should avoid the sides where rocks occasionally fall out of the small holes in the cliffside. The first weapon sensor that you encounter on your way up will contain a Fireball gun. Another weapon sensor which contains a Laser gun will appear a short distance later. Shoot the sniper waiting just above, on the far right.</p>

				<p>The Scuba soldier in the water is difficult to kill unless he is standing up, so ignore him. Higher up, there's a turret in the top right corner. Quickly jump to the upper right ledge and destroy the turret from either the bottom, or the left if you have the Spread gun. If the turret activates before you get into position, you’ll have to destroy it from the bottom, where soldiers appear from the right. Watch out for them. Further along, there’s a long bridge connecting the ledges on the left and right sides. Two small flames move back and forth across the bridge which can kill your player.</p>

				<p>Two weapon capsules will fly up from the bottom of the screen when you reach the bridge. One of them contains a Rapid fire upgrade, while the other one provides a Barrier. Be aware of the turret above you, which will activate wen you get high enough. You can easily destroy it with a Spread gun. Otherwise, you have to jump up to its height, and alternate between crouching and standing up to fire at it until it’s destroyed. Remain standing under the ledge above so that soldiers don’t leap down to attack you. After the turret is destroyed, continue jumping up until you see the floating ledge. Jump up to activate the turret nearby and destroy it. Then jump onto the floatign ledge, and beyond to the right ledge. Shoot the Scuba soldier to the left and continue. If you don’t remove him, watch out for his mortar and the pieces that break apart.</p>

				<p>Watch out for soldiers above you. When the coast is clear, carefully make your way up to the ledge above and jump onto the floating ledge on your right. The next weapon sensor contains a Machine gun. Continue jumping up and shoot the Sniper waiting on the left ledge above, then keep climbing to reach the top of the mountain, where the entrance to the second base can be found.</p>
				
				<h3>Boss: Mechanical alien</h3>
				
				<p>As soon as you arrive, move to a corner and wait for the arms to appear. Once both arms are moving around, they will shoot fireballs from their hands roughly every eight seconds. The head will also shoot out three fireballs from its mouth to the left, center, and right at slower intervals. Concentrate all of your firepower on one arm to destroy it as quickly as possible, but take time to dodge any fireballs that approach. Then fire at the second arm until it is destroyed. Next, stand slightly to either side of the head and start plugging the mouth with bullets. In the right location, you should be able to shoot its mouth without needing to fear collision with the fireballs. After the mouth is destroyed, the entire boss will explode and an entrance to the second base will appear.</p>

				<header><h2>Stage 4</h2></header>
			
				<p>The fourth stage is a more difficult version of Stage 2. There are more rooms, and the enemies are more aggressive. The power core seals also have shields on them. To destroy the cores, you must blast the shields until they crumble and reveal the seal. You'll have to be much more vigilant and avoid the increase in enemy fire in order to stay alive. Remain crouching until it's safe to stand up and continue your assault. Naturally, the Spread gun makes survival in this stage easier, but it's quite possible to complete the stage without it.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 1</h4>
				
				<p>Destroy both turrets to the left and right of the lock, then concentrate on the seal to move onto the next room.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 2</h4>
				
				<p>This room contains four seals, but none of them are shielded, and they are all on the bottom. Crouch down and fire at each seal while avoiding the gunfire overhead.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 3</h4>
				
				<p>A turret is mounted on the wall above two seals. It isn't necessary to destroy the turret, but doing so can make removing the shields and destroying the seals much easier to accomplish.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 4</h4>
				
				<p>The configuration of this room may resemble the previous room, except that the turret and seals have been moved down. The turret is not easily destroyed, but you can crouch to attack the seals and remain safe. A red soldier will provide you with a Barrier.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 5</h4>
			
				<p>Focus on the single turret in the center before you work on the seals on either side. A red soldier will provide you with a Rapid fire upgrade.</p>

				
				<h4>Room 6</h4>
			
				<p>Focus on the single turret in the center before you work on the seals on either side. A red soldier will provide you with a Rapid fire upgrade.This simple room contains a single seal, and slots for rolling mines to appear. Line yourself up with the seal and the rolling mines should miss you. Crouch when necessary, but concentrate on the seal to advance quickly.</p>
				
				
				<h4>Room 7</h4>
			
				<p>Destroy the turret, then jump up to shoot the seal above the turret.</p>
				
				<h4>Room 8</h4>
			
				<p>Destroy the turrets to the left and right of the lock quickly, then fire at the seal to destroy it. Ignore the turret above the seal.</p>
				
				
				<h3>Boss: Terminal 2</h3>
				
				<p>This battle will be similar to the previous base's final battle. Begin by destroying the power core in the way of the turret, and destroy the turret as quickly as possible. When you begin shooting the turret, two types of robotic defenders will appear from the sides; the red shooting robots and the white gliding robots. A group of these robots will appear roughly every ten seconds in alternating waves. The shooting robots appear, stop above you, and fire three bullets at you. Theses red robots have decent aim. Shoot them while they’re still moving around if possible. The white gliding robots will move to your general area and try to jump on you. They are much easier to kill. These two groups of enemies will appear endlessly until you destroy the turret and the power cores.</p>

				<p>Note that you should destroy the turret first before the rest of the power cores or the waves will continue when the boss appears. This boss is composed of four phantom images that move along the black section at the top of the screen. You can only damage the boss when two of the phantoms intersect with one other. When they do, they’ll stop for a moment before separating again. They each shoot out small bombs that travel slowly while trying to home in on your location, before speeding up in your direction. If you have a Spread gun, simply stand in the middle and fire upward. You may have to occasionally jump over the orbs if they get too close. If you don’t have a Spread gun, concentrate on one side first and then move on to the other side. Try to shoot down the bombs so you don’t have to move around too much to defeat this boss.</p>
				
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Stage_5">
			
				<header><h2>Stage 5</h2></header>
			
				<p>The next stage is a horizontally scrolling stage that takes place along a frozen tundra. There are several new enemies that make an appearance, including Gunners. From the start, head to the right but proceed carefully once you see the trees. Inch forward and duck when you see the Gunner to your right. You may be forced to move because of the grenades appearing from the trees, but don’t panic. Gunners only fire once every three seconds so there’s time to shuffle over to avoid getting hit. Continue right after the Gunner is destroyed.</p>

				<p>There’s a weapon sensor with a Machine gun beyond the Gunner. Not long afterwards an item capsule with a Rapid fire upgrade will fly by. Further ahead, there’s another cluster of trees so proceed slowly and watch out for explosions. Several more grenades will appear from the trees. Continue until you reach a weapon sensor. It contains a Fireball gun. After a short distance, three item capsules will fly by from left to right. The bottom one has a Spread gun, the middle on has another Rapid fire, and the top one is a special Falcon icon that destroys all enemies on the screen. After you collect these items, start jumping to the right and kill the sniper waiting at the end. There’s also a Scuba soldier in the water that might catch you with the right-most portion of the mortar if you're not careful.</p>

				<p>Keep running until you reach the pipes. Once you go far enough, the first armored vehicle will appear. When the screen stops scrolling, move to the far left side of the screen then a step forward. Once the tank stops moving, it’ll fire several rounds of bullets at you, which should not be able to hit you. While it’s firing you should be pumping as much ammo into it as you can before it begins to move again. You should be able to destroy it before it reaches you. After you destroy it, a Gunner will greet you. Take care of it and you’ll run into another armored vehicles. Use the same strategy against it. After that, there’s another Gunner and more groups grenades appearing from the trees. Tread carefully past them and you’ll meet one final Gunner before your showdown with the boss.</p>
	
				<h3>Boss: Anti-gravity shuttle</h3>
				
				<p>When the shuttle appears, stand a little to the left or right of its center and fire away. If you have the Spread gun, you should be able to destroy it before it disappears. If you don’t have it, the boss will let out small ships from the sides before disappearing. Wait for the little ships to get close and then jump over two of them at a time when they pass beneath you. More than two are likely to appear unless you shot them so continue jumping over them until they’re gone. When the boss appears again, stand at the edge of it and resume shooting at it. This time you should be able to destroy it before it disappears and before you have to avoid the ships again.</p>
				
			</section>						
			
			<section class="main-section" id="Stage_6">
			
				<header><h2>Stage 6</h2></header>
			
				<p>The sixth stage is known as the Energy Zone. It will be considerably difficult to complete if you attempt to rush through it, so you are advised to take your time while getting through it. Run to the right and shoot the soldiers that'll come down from the step-like ledges ahead. Kill the sniper waiting near the weapon sensor ahead. The sensor will contain a Machine gun. There'll be a Gunner on the ledge on the far right. Kill him and drop down to the very bottom to kill the Gunner waiting there. Yet another Gunner will appear once you reach the break in the middle ledge. After removing him, continue right until you see a large gap, above which is a pipe with a small flame. There is a Laser gun in the nearby weapon sensor.</p>

				<p>The flame from the pipe will shoot out as soon as you try to pass by it. To get past the flame, you'll need to jump towards it so that it shoots out and then quickly jump across as the flame is retreating back to the pipe. If you happen to die trying, jump across while you're temporarily invincible. On the other side, there will be two more Gunners waiting for you. Kill them and prepare for another flame gauntlet ahead. Be careful as you head to the right because there will be another flame here, this time coming from the wall on the far right. You'll have some warning as to when to crouch, but do so quickly or you'll be killed. Wait for the flame to retreat then quickly head closer to the wall to the right.</p>

				<p>After the flame retracts, get ready to jump to the middle ledge when the middle flame dies down. Then jump to the top after the top flame disappears. Once you're at the top, fall down to the bottom on the other side and repeat the process. When you're back at the top, kill the Sniper on the opposite ledge. Then inch forward until the flame above starts shooting out. After it retreats, quickly jump to the other side. The weapon sensor below contains a Barrier item, but it's very difficult to collect without dying unless you shoot at it first. There's another flame that shoots out from the wall on the far right. Inch forward again and then crouch when the flame shoots out, then move toward the slightly lower ledge near the wall.</p>


				<p>Once you reach the wall at the top, wait for the flame at the top and the middle ledge to retreat and then drop down. Do the same thing to get to the bottom. Note that you'll stand up momentarily when you drop down so be careful. Kill the two Gunners ahead and then jump to the middle ledge. Kill the Gunner ahead, jump to the top ledge, and then drop back down to the bottom when you're at the edge. Do not try to fall from the side of the top ledge because you'll be struck by the flame just ahead. It extends nearly to the bottom. Once you get past the flame, the boss is just ahead.</p>
	
	
				<h3>Boss: Armored Giant</h3>
				
				<p>The typical pattern of this boss is to slowly run to the left and then back to the right, at which point he'll throw out small spinning discs that move along the ground. The best way to avoid the discs is to jump over the first two, and then leap over the third one if he happens to throw it. He'll usually pause briefly because he throws the last one so that you have enough time to react. Wait on the far left and shoot at him, then jump over him whenever he gets too close. He'll start changing colors to reflect the amount of damage you've done to him. Eventually, he'll blow up after turning orange/red.</p>
				
			</section>			

			<section class="main-section" id="Stage_7">
			
				<header><h2>Stage 7</h2></header>
			
				<p>The seventh stage is another stage that requires patience to clear safely. You begin just outside of a huge complex. Head inside and jump to the upper ledge. In general, it's almost never a good idea to follow the lower route through this stage. It's usually tougher and riddled with soldiers who will appear on both sides of the screen. Stop at the four mechanical arms ahead and study their pattern for a moment. When you have the timing down, make your way through them one at a time. These arms form the basis for the challenge that you will encounter throughout the stage.</p>

				<p>Once you make it to the edge of the upper ledge an item capsule will fly by that contains a Fireball gun. If you still have the Spread gun, hold on to it. At the next ledge, there are more mechanical arms. Study the pattern and make your way past them. Pause for a moment at the edge of the ledge. If you have the Spread gun, shoot the Gunner on the higher ledge before continuing on. If you don't, just fall to the bottom and move past the mechanical arms there. It's very difficult to destroy the Gunner from the lower ledge, and if you try to climb back up, the Gunner will easily attack you, so don't try. When you get through the mechanical arms, make a short hop to the edge of the next, raised ledge. Destroy the spike wall that pops up from the ground, and each subsequent wall that appears.</p>

				<p>Once you've done that, jump to the edge of the upper ledge and destroy the spike wall there. Soldiers will begin pouring in from the left and some of them will try to jump to the ledge that you occupy. If they succeed, turn around, crouch and fire at them. You should kill them before they're able to reach the ledge. Continue to the right and move past the mechanical arms ahead. Then destroy the spike wall at the other end. Fall off the ledge and use the mine cart to get onto the ledge above you. The nearby weapon sensor contains a Barrier. Collect it, and run right through the mechanical arms ahead. Jump onto the mine cart heading to the right. If you can't collect the Barrier, don't run past the mine cart, or it will run you over and cost you a life. Once you pass two of the walls, jump onto the ledge above you and kill the sniper. Then jump across the large gap to the ledge of the right.</p>


				<p>Jump at the edge of the left ledge to clear the gap. If you miss the other side, fall to the lower right edge of the screen, onto the mine cart below. Then hop off of the cart and continue to the right past the mechanical arms. If you made to the top right ledge, destroy the series of spike walls ahead. Then fall off the ledge and destroy the set of spike walls in front of you. Fall down to the lower ledge and continue to the right. There are more mechanical arms ahead to get through. A spike wall will pop up just beyond the arms. You'll have to move left and right as the mechanical arms go up and down in order to stay alive, while you fire at the wall. When you pass this obstacle, you’ll be back on the outside. You'll encounter two Gunners and more soldiers that arrive from the left. Once you reach the slightly higher platform, another Gunner and more soldiers will appear. Defeat them to reach the boss.</p>
	
	
				<h3>Boss: Alien lair defense</h3>
				
				<p>This battle is similar to end of the first stage, but considerably tougher. There are only two enemies here; soldiers which will either appear from the door or from the far left, and a modified variety of Turrets which fire bullets into the air that split into three before they hit the ground. There are locations where you’ll be safe from the blasts. However, the turrets alternate, so you have to pay attention to where the blasts are going to land. If you find them too difficult to avoid, you can attempt to destroy them. If you only wish to destroy one, attack the one on the right. When the siren goes off, head to the far right and fire at the flashing panel above the door while avoiding the turrets. With the Spread or Laser gun, you can destroy this boss in very little time. It will take a bit longer with other weapons.</p>

				<p>The final stage may be short, but it's considerably difficult without a powerful weapon. Head to the right and destroy the two item capsules that fly by. The best way to shoot both of them is to destroy the bottom one by firing downward, and then destroy the other one by firing diagonally at it. You'll get a Machine gun and a Barrier for your effort. You'll reach the guardian of the alien lair, an alien mouth that extends from the ceiling, releasing Floaters on the screen. The easiest way to defeat it is to stand right against the wall and fire diagonally at it. Your shots should also destroy any of the Floaters that appear.</p>

				<p>Eventually the mouth and the wall will blow up, allowing you to continue. The next area will be difficult without the Spread gun. Continue to the right and you'll encounter four mouths on the ceiling. When you come up to the first two don't move any further to the right until you destroy them and the spores they release. Once the first two mouths are destroyed, move on to the next two, then jump to the little ledge. At this point, a final item capsule will fly by. You can destroy it by firing straight ahead, and it contains a Spread gun.</p>

				<p>Continue on your rampage by destroying the two mouths to the right, then jump to the next ledge and destroy the row of mouths along the bottom. Jump up to the higher ledge ahead and destroy the two mouths level with your gun. Then fall to the bottom ledge again and destroy the two sets of mouths above and below you. Jump over the two holes and destroy the next set of mouths at the bottom, then the ones at the top. Around this time, spider-like Crawlers will appear from the right. They move quickly so watch out for them. Continue to the right and you'll see one last mouth. Destroy it and you'll reach the final boss of the game.</p>

				<h3>Boss: Red Falcon</h3>
				
				<p>The target of this boss battle has no way to counter-attack, but it is very well defended, with sets of cocoons releasing Crawlers on the floor and ceiling around the heart. Destroy the Mouth near the boss if you haven’t already. Then crouch and fire at the two cocoons at the base of the heart. Crawlers are released periodically from the cocoons. Those that appear from the two cocoons at the top will try to drop down on you so pay attention above you. Once the bottom two pods are gone, stand right against the heart (it can't harm you) and fire diagonally at it. Destroy the Crawlers as they appear and continue to shoot the heart. After enough shots, the heart will explode, and you will be shown the ending to the game. Congratulations.</p>
